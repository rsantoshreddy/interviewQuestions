## Basic:

###  1. What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript?
There are many ways to create objects in javascript as below

1. **Object constructor:**

The simplest way to create an empty object is using the Object constructor. Currently this approach is not recommended.

```javascript
var object = new Object();
```

2. **Object's create method:**

The create method of Object creates a new object by passing the prototype object as a parameter

```javascript
var object = Object.create(null);
```

3. **Object literal syntax:**

The object literal syntax (or object initializer), is a comma-separated set of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.

```javascript
var object = {
  name: "Sudheer"
  age: 34
};

Object literal property values can be of any data type, including array, function, and nested object.
```

**Note:** This is an easiest way to create an object

4. **Function constructor:**

Create any function and apply the new operator to create object instances,

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = 21;
}
var object = new Person("Sudheer");
```

5. **Function constructor with prototype:**

This is similar to function constructor but it uses prototype for their properties and methods,

```javascript
function Person() {}
Person.prototype.name = "Sudheer";
var object = new Person();
```

This is equivalent to an instance created with an object create method with a function prototype and then call that function with an instance and parameters as arguments.

```javascript
function func() {};

new func(x, y, z);
```

**(OR)**

```javascript
// Create a new instance using function prototype.
var newInstance = Object.create(func.prototype)

// Call the function
var result = func.call(newInstance, x, y, z),

// If the result is a non-null object then use it otherwise just use the new instance.
console.log(result && typeof result === 'object' ? result : newInstance);
```

6. **ES6 Class syntax:**

ES6 introduces class feature to create the objects

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
 this.name = name;
  }
}

var object = new Person("Sudheer");
```

7. **Singleton pattern:**

A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance and this way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create multiple instances.

```javascript
var object = new (function () {
  this.name = "Sudheer";
})();
```
### 2. What is the difference between Call, Apply and Bind?
 The difference between Call, Apply and Bind can be explained with below examples,

**Call:** The call() method invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided one by one

```javascript
var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
  console.log(
 greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
  );
}

invite.call(employee1, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.call(employee2, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
```

**Apply:** Invokes the function with a given `this` value and allows you to pass in arguments as an array

```javascript
var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
  console.log(
 greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
  );
}

invite.apply(employee1, ["Hello", "How are you?"]); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.apply(employee2, ["Hello", "How are you?"]); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
```

**bind:** returns a new function, allowing you to pass any number of arguments

```javascript
var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
  console.log(
 greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
  );
}

var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);
var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);
inviteEmployee1("Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
inviteEmployee2("Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
```

Call and apply are pretty interchangeable. Both execute the current function immediately. You need to decide whether itâ€™s easier to send in an array or a comma separated list of arguments. You can remember by treating Call is for **comma** (separated list) and Apply is for **Array**.

Whereas Bind creates a new function that will have `this` set to the first parameter passed to bind().
### 3. What is the difference between slice and splice?
Some of the major difference in a tabular form

| Slice                                        | Splice                                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Doesn't modify the original array(immutable) | Modifies the original array(mutable)            |
| Returns the subset of original array         | Returns the deleted elements as array           |
| Used to pick the elements from array         | Used to insert or delete elements to/from array |

### 4.  What is the difference between == and === operators?
JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison. The strict operators take type of variable in consideration, while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables. The strict operators follow the below conditions for different types,

1. Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.
2. Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal. i.e, Having the same number value.
There are two special cases in this,
1. NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.
2. Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.
3. Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.
4. Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.
5. Null and Undefined types are not equal with ===, but equal with ==. i.e,
null===undefined --> false but null==undefined --> true

Some of the example which covers the above cases,

```javascript
0 == false// true
0 === false  // false
1 == "1"  // true
1 === "1" // false
null == undefined // true
null === undefined // false
'0' == false // true
'0' === false // false
[]==[] or []===[] //false, refer different objects in memory
{}=={} or {}==={} //false, refer different objects in memory
```
### 5. What is the currying function?
Currying is the process of taking a function with multiple arguments and turning it into a sequence of functions each with only a single argument. Currying is named after a mathematician **Haskell Curry**. By applying currying, a n-ary function turns it into a unary function.

Let's take an example of n-ary function and how it turns into a currying function,

```javascript
const multiArgFunction = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;
console.log(multiArgFunction(1, 2, 3)); // 6

const curryUnaryFunction = (a) => (b) => (c) => a + b + c;
curryUnaryFunction(1); // returns a function: b => c =>  1 + b + c
curryUnaryFunction(1)(2); // returns a function: c => 3 + c
curryUnaryFunction(1)(2)(3); // returns the number 6
```

Curried functions are great to improve **code reusability** and **functional composition**.

## Advanced
### 1. What is a pure function?
A **Pure function** is a function where the return value is only determined by its arguments without any side effects. i.e, If you call a function with the same arguments 'n' number of times and 'n' number of places in the application then it will always return the same value.

Let's take an example to see the difference between pure and impure functions,

```javascript
//Impure
let numberArray = [];
const impureAddNumber = (number) => numberArray.push(number);
//Pure
const pureAddNumber = (number) => (argNumberArray) =>
  argNumberArray.concat([number]);

//Display the results
console.log(impureAddNumber(6)); // returns 1
console.log(numberArray); // returns [6]
console.log(pureAddNumber(7)(numberArray)); // returns [6, 7]
console.log(numberArray); // returns [6]
```

As per the above code snippets, the **Push** function is impure itself by altering the array and returning a push number index independent of the parameter value. . Whereas **Concat** on the other hand takes the array and concatenates it with the other array producing a whole new array without side effects. Also, the return value is a concatenation of the previous array.

Remember that Pure functions are important as they simplify unit testing without any side effects and no need for dependency injection. They also avoid tight coupling and make it harder to break your application by not having any side effects. These principles are coming together with **Immutability** concept of ES6 by giving preference to **const** over **let** usage.

### 2. What is the difference between let and var?
You can list out the differences in a tabular format

| var                                                   | let                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| It is been available from the beginning of JavaScript | Introduced as part of ES6   |
| It has function scope                                 | It has block scope          |
| Variables will be hoisted                             | Hoisted but not initialized |

Let's take an example to see the difference,

```javascript
function userDetails(username) {
  if (username) {
console.log(salary); // undefined due to hoisting
console.log(age); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'age' before initialization
let age = 30;
var salary = 10000;
  }
  console.log(salary); //10000 (accessible to due function scope)
  console.log(age); //error: age is not defined(due to block scope)
}
userDetails("John");
```
### 3. What is the Temporal Dead Zone?
The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable with the let and const keywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a `let` or `const` variable before its declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError. The time span when that happens, between the creation of a variableâ€™s binding and its declaration, is called the temporal dead zone.

Let's see this behavior with an example,

```javascript
function somemethod() {
  console.log(counter1); // undefined
  console.log(counter2); // ReferenceError
  var counter1 = 1;
  let counter2 = 2;
}
```
### 4. What is Hoisting?
 Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables, function declarations and classes are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation.
Let's take a simple example of variable hoisting,

```javascript
console.log(message); //output : undefined
var message = "The variable Has been hoisted";
```

The above code looks like as below to the interpreter,

```javascript
var message;
console.log(message);
message = "The variable Has been hoisted";
```

In the same fashion, function declarations are hoisted too

```javascript
message("Good morning"); //Good morning

function message(name) {
  console.log(name);
}
```

This hoisting makes functions to be safely used in code before they are declared.

### 5. What are closures?
 A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. i.e, It is an inner function that has access to the outer or enclosing functionâ€™s variables. The closure has three scope chains

1. Own scope where variables defined between its curly brackets
2. Outer functionâ€™s variables
3. Global variables

Let's take an example of closure concept,

```javascript
function Welcome(name) {
  var greetingInfo = function (message) {
console.log(message + " " + name);
  };
  return greetingInfo;
}
var myFunction = Welcome("John");
myFunction("Welcome "); //Output: Welcome John
myFunction("Hello Mr."); //output: Hello Mr.John
```

As per the above code, the inner function(i.e, greetingInfo) has access to the variables in the outer function scope(i.e, Welcome) even after the outer function has returned.

## Basic:

###  1. What is the difference between state and props?

 Both *props* and *state* are plain JavaScript objects. While both of them hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in their functionality with respect to component. Props get passed to the component similar to function parameters whereas state is managed within the component similar to variables declared within a function.

### 2. What are synthetic events in React?

`SyntheticEvent` is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event. Its API is same as the browser's native event, including `stopPropagation()` and `preventDefault()`, except the events work identically across all browsers.

### 3. Why should we not update the state directly?

If you try to update the state directly then it won't re-render the component.

```javascript
//Wrong
this.state.message = 'Hello world'
```

Instead use `setState()` method. It schedules an update to a component's state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.

```javascript
//Correct
this.setState({ message: 'Hello World' })
```

**Note:** You can directly assign to the state object either in *constructor* or using latest javascript's class field declaration syntax.

### 4. What is the use of refs?

The *ref* is used to return a reference to the element. They *should be avoided* in most cases, however, they can be useful when you need a direct access to the DOM element or an instance of a component.

### 5. What is Virtual DOM?

The *Virtual DOM* (VDOM) is an in-memory representation of *Real DOM*. The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM. It's a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. This entire process is called *reconciliation*.



## Advanced

### 1. What is Redux and explain how it works?

Redux is an open-source JavaScript library used to manage application state. React uses Redux for building the user interface. 

React Redux is the official React binding for Redux. It allows React components to read data from a Redux Store, and dispatch Actions to the Store to update data. Redux helps apps to scale by providing a sensible way to manage state through a unidirectional data flow model. React Redux is conceptually simple. It subscribes to the Redux store, checks to see if the data which your component wants have changed, and re-renders your component.

To use react redux we have to wrap our app with React Redux Provider and component has to be wrapped with connect method. Connect method is a higher order component which takes two methods and the component itself. 

`e.g connect(mapStateToPrps, mapDispatchToProps)(Component);`

### 2. What are the different phases of component lifecycle?

The component lifecycle has three distinct lifecycle phases:

1. **Mounting:** The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers initialization from `constructor()`, `getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `render()`, and `componentDidMount()` lifecycle methods.

2. **Updating:** In this phase, the component gets updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state either from `setState()` or `forceUpdate()`. This phase covers `getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `shouldComponentUpdate()`, `render()`, `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` and `componentDidUpdate()` lifecycle methods.

3. **Unmounting:** In this last phase, the component is not needed and gets unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes `componentWillUnmount()` lifecycle method.

It's worth mentioning that React internally has a concept of phases when applying changes to the DOM. They are separated as follows

1. **Render** The component will render without any side effects. This applies to Pure components and in this phase, React can pause, abort, or restart the render.

2. **Pre-commit** Before the component actually applies the changes to the DOM, there is a moment that allows React to read from the DOM through the `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`.

3. **Commit** React works with the DOM and executes the final lifecycles respectively `componentDidMount()` for mounting, `componentDidUpdate()` for updating, and `componentWillUnmount()` for unmounting.

### 3. What are the lifecycle methods of React?

Before React 16.3

- **componentWillMount:** Executed before rendering and is used for App level configuration in your root component.
- **componentDidMount:** Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.
- **componentWillReceiveProps:** Executed when particular prop updates to trigger state transitions.
- **shouldComponentUpdate:** Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default it returns `true`. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives new prop.
- **componentWillUpdate:** Executed before re-rendering the component when there are props & state changes confirmed by `shouldComponentUpdate()` which returns true.
- **componentDidUpdate:** Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.
- **componentWillUnmount:** It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.

React 16.3+

- **getDerivedStateFromProps:** Invoked right before calling `render()` and is invoked on *every* render. This exists for rare use cases where you need a derived state. Worth reading [if you need derived state](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html).
- **componentDidMount:** Executed after first rendering and where all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.
- **shouldComponentUpdate:** Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default, it returns `true`. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after the state or props are updated, you can return a false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives a new prop.
- **getSnapshotBeforeUpdate:** Executed right before rendered output is committed to the DOM. Any value returned by this will be passed into `componentDidUpdate()`. This is useful to capture information from the DOM i.e. scroll position.
- **componentDidUpdate:** Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes. This will not fire if `shouldComponentUpdate()` returns `false`.
- **componentWillUnmount** It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.

### 4. What are Higher-Order Components?

A *higher-order component* (*HOC*) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Basically, it's a pattern that is derived from React's compositional nature.

We call them **pure components** because they can accept any dynamically provided child component but they won't modify or copy any behavior from their input components.

```javascript
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent)
```

HOC can be used for many use cases:

1. Code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction.
2. Render hijacking.
3. State abstraction and manipulation.
4. Props manipulation.
    
### 5. What is context and why we prefer redux then context?

*Context* provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

For example, authenticated users, locale preferences, UI themes need to be accessed in the application by many components.

```javascript
const {Provider, Consumer} = React.createContext(defaultValue)
```
Comparing Redux & Context API
| Context API  | 	Redux  |
|:-:|:-:|
| Built-in tool that ships with React  | Additional installation Required, driving up the final bundle size  |
| Requires minimal Setup  | Requires extensive setup to integrate it with a React Application  |
| Specifically designed for static data, that is not often refreshed or updated  | Works like a charm with both static and dynamic data  |
| Adding new contexts requires creation from scratch	  | Easily extendible due to the ease of adding new data/actions after the initial setup  |
| Debugging can be hard in highly nested React Component Structure even with Dev Tool | Incredibly powerful Redux Dev Tools to ease debugging  |
| UI logic and State Management Logic are in the same component	  | Better code organization with separate UI logic and State Management Logic  |
